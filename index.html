                    <div class="description">For my final year project in university I successfully showed that the machine learning paradigm, Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to create an artificially 
                        intelligent simulated robot capable of homing, using a Lidar sensor. This project was accomplished through the use of Double Deep Q-Learning, an effective and efficient 
                        variation of the well-known RL algorithm Q-Learning. 
                        With the recent resurgence of RL in the rise of AI I was very excited about exploring the possibilities of algorithms such as Q-Learning on (simulated) robots.
                        Simulated robot homing is a fundamental problem in robotics that has been studied extensively. The goal of robot homing is for a robot to navigate from an initial 
                        position to a target location without relying on external sensors or pre-defined maps. This task is particularly challenging because robots must deal with noisy sensors, 
                        uncertain dynamics, and complex environments. The challenging nature of robot homing requires the design of RL algorithms that can handle high-dimensional state and action 
                        spaces while ensuring stability and convergence. Designing such algorithms requires expertise in both robotics and machine.
